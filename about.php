<h1>Welcome to Reclinathon.</h1>
<BR><H3>
Reclinathon is not just an event.  Reclinathon is the pinnacle of dudliness--a great festival that brings together dudes of the world for one purpose and 
one purpose only--ultimate movie bliss. <BR><BR>

Each season thousands of dudes* gather together to participate in this glorious sporting event, each highly trained and discilpined, fully prepared
for the task that awaits them all.  This task is simple in theory, but it takes a special breed of human to accomplish its magnitude.  Each reclinee is 
expected to recline, watch movies, eat food, and most importantly, remain in the dudely spirit for 26.2 straight hours of fierce competition.
<BR><BR>
Are you up to the challenge?

Are you dude enough to accept the challenge?<BR><BR><BR></H3>
