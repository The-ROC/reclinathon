Imagine you are a last-minute substitute for a member of the ROC (someone slept in after spending all night making a sign--again)  Part of your duties are to choose the movies that will be shown at Reclinathon.  Which of the following films would you pick? (choices include some Pauly Shore movie, some awesome movie not in DVD format, Small Time Crooks starring Hugh Grant, etc.)
A:  Bio Dome
B:  An awesome pre-release version of Quantum of Solace that you downloaded from the internet
C:  Small Time Crooks starring Hugh Grant
D:  Made of Honor  (OMG, I LOVE that movie)
E:  The Dark Knight in 4:3 aspect ratio
F:  Season 1 of Family Guy

You are deeply entrenched in the Reclinathon arena, proud of yourself for how much success you are having so far.  It's been 18.7 hours, it's halfway into the 9th movie of the event, and you have yet to remove your posterior from a legally accepted reclining device.  In short, you are on your way to finishing the Reclinathon successfully--heck, you might even win!  All of a sudden, the previous meal of buffalo wings and Croc Monsieur starts to affect you, and your throat becomes incredibly dry.  You are really thirsty, and you feel a cough coming on.  Not wanting to disturb your fellow Reclinees, you decide to quench your thirst with a nutritious Mountain Dew.  You reach into to your registration pack, and to your horror, you can't find your 'Mountain Dew Reclinathon Buck' anywhere.  Desperate for a drink, you consider your options.  What do you do?

A:  Decide that it's not worth the pain and a distracting cough for your fellow Reclinees.  Get up and run to get some water.  It's been a good Reclinathon, and there's always next season.
B:  Be a Dude an suck it up.  You can get a drink after the movie is over (Who the hell chose King Kong anyway?).  And your fellow Reclinees will just have to deal with the cough.
C:  Try to negotiate a deal with your neighbor.  Perhaps you can barter 50 of your 60 waffles in exchange for his Mountain Dew Reclinathon Buck.
D:  Fortunately you were well prepared, and you reach into your emergency supplies for some carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, concentrated orange juice, citric acid, natural flavors, and caffeine.  (Unfortunately, you forgot the sodium benzoate--preserving freshness is an unnecessary luxury)  You mix up a batch of Moonshine Dew and continue on with the event.
E:  Emergency procedures:  Fall Asleep
